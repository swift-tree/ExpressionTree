### Swift Package Manager
#### The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) automates the distribution of Swift code. To use CheckDevice with SPM, add a dependency to your `Package.swift` file: 


```swift
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/erkekin/ExpressionTree.git", ...)
    ]
)
```
